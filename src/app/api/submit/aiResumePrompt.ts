This template provides a standardized, ATS-focused evaluation of a resume, ensuring consistent scoring and actionable feedback. The score is calculated using a weighted formula to minimize variability.

1. üìä ATS Compatibility Score

**Scoring Criteria (Out of 100)**

Use the following weighted breakdown:

| Category                   | Weight |
|----------------------------|--------|
| Keyword Match              | 40%    |
| Formatting Compatibility   | 20%    |
| Content Quality & Clarity  | 20%    |
| Missing Critical Areas     | 10%    |
| Improvement Suggestions    | 10%    |

Use the following formula to calculate the score:

> **Total Score = (Keyword Match % √ó 0.4) + (Formatting Compatibility % √ó 0.2) + (Content Strength % √ó 0.2) + (Missing Critical Areas Score √ó 0.1) + (Improvement Suggestions Score √ó 0.1)**

- Keyword Match: % of relevant skills/tools/terms aligned with the role.
- Formatting Compatibility: Use of standard headers, fonts, no graphics/tables, bullet points, etc.
- Content Strength: Use of action verbs, measurable outcomes, complete sections.
- Missing Critical Areas: Deduct points for missing expected technologies, soft skills, or experience.
- Improvement Suggestions: Deduct if there are many improvements needed.


**Be strict.** Do not give 90+ scores unless the resume is excellent. If it‚Äôs average or missing key elements, keep it under 80. Anything needing improvement should be 70 or below.


Consistency Note: The same resume will yield the same score unless the job description or analyzer settings change.

2. üîç Key Strengths
List 3‚Äì10 strengths of the resume (e.g., strong keyword alignment, clear formatting, or quantifiable achievements).

Example: (give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Matches 80% of job-specific keywords, including "[skill 1]" and "[skill 2]."
Uses ATS-friendly fonts (e.g., Arial) and clear section headings.
Includes measurable achievements, like "[specific accomplishment]."

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing or Weak Areas
List 3‚Äì10 skills, tools, or experiences expected for the role but missing or underdeveloped in the resume.
Example: (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume. also give the points directly as bullet poins instead having a subheading)
Lacks mention of "[specific skill/tool]" listed in the job description.
Limited use of quantifiable metrics in work experience.
Missing certifications relevant to the role (e.g., "[certification name]")."

4. üìà Suggestions for Improvement
Provide 3‚Äì10 actionable recommendations to enhance the resume‚Äôs alignment with the job description and ATS compatibility and how to increase the current ATS Compatibility Score.
Example:  (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume. also give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Add specific keywords like "[keyword]" to the skills or experience sections to improve the current ats score.
Replace tables with bullet points to improve ATS parsing.
Include quantifiable results, e.g., ‚Äúincreased [metric] by [X%].‚Äù
Add a dedicated ‚ÄúCertifications‚Äù section for [certification name].

5. üìã ATS Optimization Tips
Offer 3‚Äì10 specific tips to make the resume more ATS-friendly.
Example:  (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume.  also give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Use standard section headings like ‚ÄúWork Experience‚Äù or ‚ÄúSkills.‚Äù
Include both acronyms and full terms, e.g., ‚ÄúCertified Public Accountant (CPA).‚Äù
Save the resume as a PDF or DOCX file without headers/footers.
Avoid graphics, logos, or complex formatting that may confuse ATS parsers.

6. üîß Skill Analysis
Analyze the resume content and extract individual hard skills (e.g., JavaScript, React, Docker) and soft skills (e.g., Communication, Leadership) that are clearly demonstrated through projects, work experience, or achievements.
For each skill you identify, evaluate and assign a score out of 100 based on the depth and strength of evidence provided in the resume. This score should reflect how confidently the candidate has shown that skill (not just whether it is mentioned, but how well it is backed up).

Instructions:
Do not include visual elements or charts. Only list the skills and scores in plain text.
Focus only on skills explicitly demonstrated or strongly implied by context (projects, results, job roles, responsibilities).
Ignore skills that are only passively mentioned in the resume with no evidence or usage context.

Score the skills realistically:
90‚Äì100: Expert-level mastery, used extensively in key projects or roles.
70‚Äì89: Strong proficiency, consistently applied across experiences.
50‚Äì69: Moderate exposure or usage in one or two areas.
<50: Mentioned, but little to no demonstrated application.

Include at least 4‚Äì6 skills, combining technical and soft skills when possible.

Format your output as plain bullet points, like: (just for an example, do not use these exact skills)
üîßReact.js: 82
üîßNode.js: 75
üîßCommunication: 68
üîßDocker: 55
üîßLeadership: 60

üîí Important:
Only rate skills that are supported by real usage or achievements in the resume.

Be concise and objective. Do not add explanations, summaries, or section titles ‚Äî only the skill and its score.

7. üß∞ Skill Distribution
Analyze the resume content and categorize all mentioned skills into the following four groups:
Technical Skills (e.g., programming languages, tools, frameworks, systems)
Soft Skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, leadership)
Industry Knowledge (e.g., domain-specific knowledge, processes, methodologies)
Certifications (formal certifications, licenses, or training programs)
Determine what percentage of the resume content is focused on each of these categories. Base the percentages on actual content ‚Äî such as mentions, emphasis, and context of usage ‚Äî and ensure the total equals 100%.

Output Format:
Only use plain bullet points with the emoji üß∞, followed by the category name and a number (no % sign). Do not add titles, extra text, or explanation.

Example Output (do not copy values below, just the format):
üß∞Technical Skills: 40
üß∞Soft Skills: 30
üß∞Industry Knowledge: 20
üß∞Certifications: 10

Be objective. Use full resume context to derive accurate skill proportions.
