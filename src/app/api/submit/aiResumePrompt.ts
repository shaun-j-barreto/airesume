This template provides a standardized, ATS-focused evaluation of a resume, ensuring consistent scoring and actionable feedback. The score is calculated using a weighted formula to minimize variability.

1. 📊 ATS Compatibility Score

**Scoring Criteria (Out of 100)**

Instead of calculating the total ATS Compatibility Score, return only the following five component scores out of 100, based on this breakdown:

| Component                  | Weight |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Keyword Match             | 40%    |
| Formatting Compatibility  | 20%    |
| Content Quality & Clarity | 20%    |
| Missing Critical Areas    | 10%    |
| Improvement Suggestions   | 10%    |

Instructions:
- Assign each component a number between 0 and 100 based on how the resume performs.
- Be strict and objective — do not inflate scores.
- Only return the five scores in plain text like this:

{{SCORE_START}} (just an example, do not use these exact values)
🔢Keyword Match: 75
🔢Formatting Compatibility: 85
🔢Content Quality & Clarity: 80
🔢Missing Critical Areas: 70
🔢Improvement Suggestions: 65
{{SCORE_END}}

-Use these rubrics for consistency:

🔢 Keyword Match (0–100)
Rate based on how many relevant, role-specific keywords (tools, frameworks, responsibilities) appear naturally throughout the resume.
90–100: 90%+ match with highly relevant, well-distributed keywords
70–89: Good coverage but minor gaps
50–69: Some important skills/terms missing
<50: Very poor alignment or irrelevant keywords

🔢 Formatting Compatibility (0–100)
Assess whether the resume uses ATS-friendly formatting:
90–100: Clean structure, standard fonts, no tables/images, clear section headers
70–89: Generally clean but has 1–2 minor formatting flaws
50–69: Moderate issues (tables, graphics, inconsistent sections)
<50: Poor formatting; not ATS-parsable

🔢 Content Quality & Clarity (0–100)
Evaluate clarity, conciseness, grammar, and use of action-oriented language:
90–100: Excellent grammar, clear impact statements, good flow
70–89: Mostly clear with a few weak areas
50–69: Several vague or passive statements
<50: Unclear or generic content

🔢 Missing Critical Areas (0–100)
Deduct based on missing sections (e.g., Projects, Summary, Certifications) or key role-specific skills.
90–100: Nothing important missing
70–89: Only 1–2 minor things missing
50–69: Lacks multiple role-critical sections
<50: Missing core sections or role-essential content

🔢 Improvement Suggestions (0–100)
Rate how many improvements are needed (deduct if multiple weak points exist):
90–100: Almost nothing to improve
70–89: Minor enhancements needed
50–69: Moderate number of actionable improvements
<50: Resume needs significant restructuring or rework

Do **not** include the total score — we will calculate that ourselves.

Be concise and only list the values. Do not include any explanations or formatting.

2. 🔍 Key Strengths
List 3–10 strengths of the resume (e.g., strong keyword alignment, clear formatting, or quantifiable achievements).

Example: (give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Matches 80% of job-specific keywords, including "[skill 1]" and "[skill 2]."
Uses ATS-friendly fonts (e.g., Arial) and clear section headings.
Includes measurable achievements, like "[specific accomplishment]."

3. ⚠️ Missing or Weak Areas
List 3–10 skills, tools, or experiences expected for the role but missing or underdeveloped in the resume.
Example: (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume. also give the points directly as bullet poins instead having a subheading)
Lacks mention of "[specific skill/tool]" listed in the job description.
Limited use of quantifiable metrics in work experience.
Missing certifications relevant to the role (e.g., "[certification name]")."

4. 📈 Suggestions for Improvement
Provide 3–10 actionable recommendations to enhance the resume’s alignment with the job description and ATS compatibility and how to increase the current ATS Compatibility Score.
Example:  (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume. also give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Add specific keywords like "[keyword]" to the skills or experience sections to improve the current ats score.
Replace tables with bullet points to improve ATS parsing.
Include quantifiable results, e.g., “increased [metric] by [X%].”
Add a dedicated “Certifications” section for [certification name].

5. 📋 ATS Optimization Tips
Offer 3–10 specific tips to make the resume more ATS-friendly.
Example:  (this are just examples, does'nt necessarily have to be used, give points that are relevant to the resume.  also give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)
Use standard section headings like “Work Experience” or “Skills.”
Include both acronyms and full terms, e.g., “Certified Public Accountant (CPA).”
Save the resume as a PDF or DOCX file without headers/footers.
Avoid graphics, logos, or complex formatting that may confuse ATS parsers.

6. 🔧 Skill Analysis
Analyze the resume content and extract individual hard skills (e.g., JavaScript, React, Docker) and soft skills (e.g., Communication, Leadership) that are clearly demonstrated through projects, work experience, or achievements.
For each skill you identify, evaluate and assign a score out of 100 based on the depth and strength of evidence provided in the resume. This score should reflect how confidently the candidate has shown that skill (not just whether it is mentioned, but how well it is backed up).

Instructions:
Do not include visual elements or charts. Only list the skills and scores in plain text.
Focus only on skills explicitly demonstrated or strongly implied by context (projects, results, job roles, responsibilities).
Ignore skills that are only passively mentioned in the resume with no evidence or usage context.

Score the skills realistically:
90–100: Expert-level mastery, used extensively in key projects or roles.
70–89: Strong proficiency, consistently applied across experiences.
50–69: Moderate exposure or usage in one or two areas.
<50: Mentioned, but little to no demonstrated application.

Include at least 4–6 skills, combining technical and soft skills when possible.

Format your output as plain bullet points, like: (just for an example, do not use these exact skills)
🔧React.js: 82
🔧Node.js: 75
🔧Communication: 68
🔧Docker: 55
🔧Leadership: 60

🔒 Important:
Only rate skills that are supported by real usage or achievements in the resume.

Be concise and objective. Do not add explanations, summaries, or section titles — only the skill and its score.

7. 🧰 Skill Distribution
Analyze the resume content and categorize all mentioned skills into the following four groups:
Technical Skills (e.g., programming languages, tools, frameworks, systems)
Soft Skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, leadership)
Industry Knowledge (e.g., domain-specific knowledge, processes, methodologies)
Certifications (formal certifications, licenses, or training programs)
Determine what percentage of the resume content is focused on each of these categories. Base the percentages on actual content — such as mentions, emphasis, and context of usage — and ensure the total equals 100%.

Output Format:
Only use plain bullet points with the emoji 🧰, followed by the category name and a number (no % sign). Do not add titles, extra text, or explanation.

Example Output (do not copy values below, just the format):
🧰Technical Skills: 40
🧰Soft Skills: 30
🧰Industry Knowledge: 20
🧰Certifications: 10

Be objective. Use full resume context to derive accurate skill proportions.
