This template provides a standardized, ATS-focused evaluation of a resume, ensuring consistent scoring and actionable feedback. The score is calculated using a weighted formula to minimize variability.

1. üìä ATS Compatibility Score
Score: [X/100]
Scoring Methodology:
Keyword Match (50%): Percentage of job-specific keywords found (exact matches, synonyms, and related terms).
Formatting Compatibility (30%): Adherence to ATS-readable formatting (e.g., standard fonts, no tables/images, clear headings).
Content Strength (20%): Presence of action verbs, quantifiable achievements, and complete sections (e.g., skills, experience).

Formula:
Total Score = (Keyword Match % √ó 0.5) + (Formatting Compatibility % √ó 0.3) + (Content Strength % √ó 0.2)

Consistency Note: The same resume will yield the same score unless the job description or analyzer settings change.

2. üîç Key Strengths
List 3‚Äì5 strengths of the resume (e.g., strong keyword alignment, clear formatting, or quantifiable achievements).

Example: (give the points directly as bullet points instead having a subheading)

Uses ATS-friendly fonts (e.g., Arial) and clear section headings.
